# What is dDog?

Free-to-play play-to-earn TWA using TON blockchain and NFT technologies with a clear UX.
Application offers an intuitive interface, an easy login to the game without the need to download additional applications and an easy connection to the wallet.

## How it works?
When the user launches the bot, each player is given 100 game coins and a dDog character with an initial level. This is enough to start playing and winning. There will be several single and multiplayer games to choose from.

### Games

In single games, you can earn only game coins, and in multiplay games, both game coins and real TON coins. Both players make the same bet amount, the winner takes everything (minus a small commission to the game).
The amount of the reward depends on the level of the character, and on his characteristics.

### Marketplace

Characteristics give advantages in mini-games. They can be obtained by raising the level or buying NFT in the form of clothing. The NFT attributes contain all the characteristics.
You can change your clothes in the wardrobe, and you can buy new ones in the built-in marketplace.
